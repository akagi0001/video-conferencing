# WebSPA based on React

## Development
The ASP.Net Core Project is just a shell around the React App. You can develop the React app as usual using your favorite editor (I use VSCode) in the `/Client` directory. To debug the React app, you may just start the ASP.Net Core project, in Debug mode it will serve the React app using the `start` script (so hot reload etc. will be available).
