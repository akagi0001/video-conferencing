## About The Project
Last year when I was tutor at my university, I had to use BigBlueButton which was a very frustrating experience. I wondered how hard it can be to create a video conference system and that's how Strive was started. You can find a list with issues of BBB I wanted to address [here](./advantages_over_bbb.md).
